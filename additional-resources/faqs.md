## What is the difference between 'Net ROI \(1mo\)' and '$ ROI \(1mo\)'?

$ ROI \(1mo\) shows your returns measured in USD. This simply looks at $ difference over 1 month period.

Net ROI \(1mo\) is the impermanent gain or loss you would have experienced if you were providing liquidity for 1 month. In other words this shows whether you were better off pooling or just holding your underlying assets. If negative, that means you would experience impermanent loss supplying liquidity to that pool over 1 month. If positive that means exchange fees generated by that pool, outweighed any losses due to price fluctuations during that month. Best case scenario for liquidity providers is when you ADD and WITHDRAW liquidity when underlying assets are around the same price.
