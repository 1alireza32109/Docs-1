{% tab title="What is DeFi?" %}
### DeFi represents a broad category of financial applications that are being developed on top of open, trust-minimized, programmable and censorship resistant networks to improve upon the legacy financial system or create entirely new use-cases.

### Today most of these new applications are deployed on Ethereum.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="DeFi vs FinTech" %}
### The internet tremendously improved communication and trade execution speeds but was not able to transform finance at its most critical point: _the creation of new instruments._

### Ethereum enables anyone to programmatically control digital value through ‘smart contracts’. Smart contracts are essentially computer programs that escrow and then reallocate value based on certain conditions.

### These conditions could effectively replicate swaps, options, futures, bonds, or other financial instruments which are executed and settled by Ethereum’s decentralized network with immutable records.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Why is this important?" %}
### What's interesting is that anyone is able to write smart contracts and create new financial instruments such as money markets, exchanges and asset management solutions.

### The internet disinter-mediated traditional media over the last twenty years by providing wealth building tools to content creators. 

{% hint style="info" %}
## Ethereum is doing to finance what the internet did to the media by democratizing the creation of new financial instruments.

{% tab title="Our Mission" %}
