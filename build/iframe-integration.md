# iFrame Integration

An iFrame embeds specific Zap cards aka strategies to your website.

### **Why You May Want This**

* Zapper  abstracts the complexities of getting in, out, and between unique positions & strategies in DeFi. Adding Zapper iFrame on your site, you can easily enable users to take actions via Zaps based on their goals.

### Add To Your Site

To include Zapper iFrame within your site just add an iFrame element within your website code and link to a specific Zap page.

Linking to a sETH Unipool zap page would look something like this. To link to a Zap of your choice replace the URL in 'src'.
