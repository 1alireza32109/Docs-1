# ðŸ”ŒENS Connectors

We've registered some popular pools with the Ethereum Name Service so that adding liquidity is as easy as sending a text. Simply send your ETH to a human-readable address and you will become a liquidity provider for that pool. No UI required.

**NOTE: YOU CAN EXECUTE THESE ACTIONS WITH ETH DEPOSITS ONLY. DO NOT SEND ERC20 TOKENS.**
