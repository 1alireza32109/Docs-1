# What is Zapper and How to Get Started

## What is Zapper?
Zapper is your DeFi dashboard for monitoring your portfolio, includes assets, debts, liquidity pools, and yield farming––but it requires you to share no personal data! Just connect your Ethereum wallet or paste in the ETH address / ENS domain. 
Zapper is also your gateway to investing in hundreds of DeFi strategies in just a few clicks. Zaps can save you time, effort, and transaction fees (gas) by deploying your capital and reallocating it in a single DeFi command control center, working with the most trusted DeFi applications like yearn.finance, Uniswap, Balancer, Curve, and more.

## What is a Zap?
A Zap provides an open source front-end interface for traders and liquidity providers to easily interact with the smart contracts of popular DeFi protocols. In other words, Zaps empower you to use applications like Uniswap, yearn.finance, Balancer, and Curve in a few clicks without having to open each of their signature websites. You can explore hundreds of Zaps available at [zapper.fi/invest](https://zapper.fi/invest). Zapping also allows you to save on transaction fees.

## Why should I use zap in the first place?
Besides allowing you to “zap” into defi protocols without going into their respective website, Zap also allows you to save on transaction fees. See the below tweet by one of our co-founders, Nodar, on a concrete example of this.

## Do I need a Zapper account?
No. You can just connect your Ethereum wallet through one of the many options available including MetaMask, WalletConnect, Fortmatic and more (see screenshot below). Remember, you can connect multiple wallets or paste in the address by clicking the dropdown menu next to your wallet address in the top left next to the Zapper logo and choosing Manage Addresses to paste in a valid ETH address or your ENS domain.

## Does Zapper ever have control of my assets?
No. Zapper does not custody or control your assets. Our Dashboard draws from on-chain data after you connect your wallet to visualize a snapshot of your DeFi portfolio. Our Zaps help to add liquidity, withdraw liquidity, or rebalance liquidity between 2 platforms.

## Does Zapper charge fees?
No. The fees you pay are strictly those required by the Ethereum network to compensate miners who ensure your transaction gets confirmed in a block.

## Do you support other protocols besides Ethereum?
Not at the moment but we will consider doing so in the future as long as there are users and liquidity on other chains. It's our team view that 99.9% of DeFi activity is on Ethereum at the moment.
